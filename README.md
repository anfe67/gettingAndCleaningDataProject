## Introduction

The implementation of the project consists of a single script, run_analysis.R. It has been developed using RStudio version 0.99.447, and R version 3.2.2 under Linux. 

### Contents of the submission

My submission contains the following files:  

* README.md - This file
* CodeBook.md - The description of the data and 
* run_analysis.R -  The scripts that performs all the requested data cleaning operations and also the requested analysis. Every single line of the script is commented, and every operation is reproducible. There are no difficult steps, it is just a plain sequence of R commands
* analysedData.txt - The result of the analysis saved to TXT format
* analysedData.csv - The result of the analysis saved to CSV format (which I prefer)
* fullDataWithMeanStdWithActNames.txt - The intermediate product saved to TXT format
* fullDataWithMeanStdWithActNames.csv - The intermediate product saved to CSV format

### Options 

Some portions of the code are commented, and they only have an educational purpose. These are optionals, for instance the user can select the destination directory from the R Studio environment, it is not necessary to do it in the script. Other represent an alternative way to obtain the same result and I kept them in the script as comments.
